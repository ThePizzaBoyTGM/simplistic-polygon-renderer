# simplistic-polygon-renderer
Welcome to my program.
My program easily and quickly renders polygons with thousands and even millions of sides.
Most polygons cannot be displayed as the sides are too small to fit into a pixel.
When it is done rendering, you will have to restart the program to render another one.
